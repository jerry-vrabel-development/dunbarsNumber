# Dunbar's Number

Proposed by anthropologist [Robin Dunbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar), Dunbar's Number is a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom an individual can maintain stable social relationships. This concept is based on the idea that there are limits to the human brain's capacity for social bonding and interaction.

## Specifically, Dunbar proposed different layers of social relationships based on group size:

### Close Relationships (5)

At the innermost layer are the closest relationships, typically consisting of about 5 individuals. These are people with whom we have strong emotional bonds, such as family members or very close friends.

### Sympathy Group (15)

The next layer consists of about 15 individuals. These are people with whom we have frequent contact and feel a sense of kinship or camaraderie. They may include close friends and extended family members.

### Social Cohort (50)

Beyond the sympathy group are approximately 50 individuals. These are people with whom we have more casual interactions, such as regular social acquaintances, colleagues, or members of shared interest groups.

### Community (150)

The outermost layer is the community, consisting of about 150 individuals. This is the maximum number of people with whom an individual can maintain meaningful, stable relationships. In traditional human societies, this might represent a small village or tribe.

Dunbar's Number suggests that our cognitive capacity places constraints on the size and complexity of our social networks. Beyond a certain point, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain meaningful relationships with additional individuals. This concept has been supported by various studies across different cultures and contexts, although the exact number may vary slightly.

In the context of startups and organizations, Dunbar's Number is often cited to highlight the challenges of maintaining a cohesive culture and effective communication as a company grows beyond a certain size. When a company exceeds Dunbar's Number, it becomes more difficult for employees to know each other well, resulting in potential communication bottlenecks, decreased trust, and a greater reliance on formal structures and processes to manage interactions. Therefore, understanding Dunbar's Number can inform strategies for managing organizational growth, fostering relationships, and preserving a sense of community within larger teams.

## Dunbar's Number - Social Media

Creating a social media app based on Dunbar's Number algorithm is fascinating concept. Here are some potential features and concepts I will explore:

1. **Limited Connections:** Implement a limit on the number of connections a user can have, based on Dunbar's Number. Users could only add a certain number of friends or connections, encouraging them to prioritize relationships with those they truly care about.

2. **Relationship Strength Indicator:** Develop a feature that quantifies the strength of a user's relationships based on interactions, frequency of communication, and shared interests. This could help users identify and nurture their most meaningful connections within the app.

3. **Community Building:** Facilitate the creation of smaller, intimate communities within the app, each capped at around 150 members. Users could join communities based on shared interests, location, or other factors, fostering a sense of belonging and connection akin to a close-knit village or tribe.

4. **Focused Communication:** Design communication tools that encourage meaningful interactions and discourage spam or superficial engagement. For example, you could prioritize personal messages over public posts, or implement a feature that limits the frequency of updates to prevent information overload.

5. **Privacy and Security:** Emphasize user privacy and security by implementing robust privacy settings and data protection measures. Users should feel confident that their personal information and interactions are safe within the app.

6. **Content Curation:** Develop algorithms that prioritize content from users' closest connections, ensuring that they don't miss important updates or posts from their inner circle amidst the noise of the broader social network.

7. **Real-Life Integration:** Explore ways to bridge the gap between online interactions and real-life relationships. This could include features for organizing offline meetups, coordinating group activities, or sharing recommendations for local events and venues.

8. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Allow users to provide feedback on the quality and relevance of their interactions within the app. Use this feedback to continuously refine and improve the user experience, ensuring that the app remains aligned with users' needs and preferences.

9. **Psychological Support:** Integrate features that promote mental well-being and healthy social interactions. This could include resources for managing relationship conflicts, fostering empathy and understanding, or providing support during times of emotional distress.

10. **Research and Education:** Use the app as a platform for educating users about Dunbar's Number and its implications for social networks and relationships. Provide resources, articles, and interactive content to help users understand the science behind the app's design principles.

By incorporating these concepts into your social media app, you can create a unique and engaging platform that promotes meaningful connections, fosters community, and prioritizes quality over quantity in users' social interactions.
